13.) For security, the system should ensure that the password is not completely plain text, and is 8 to 26(for example) characters long.

Non-Functional Requirements:-

1.) Accessibility:- The proposed system would be a GUI-based desktop application installed on the computing root node (server) running the application.

2.)  Ease of use - The system should make sure that the user can get relevant information with ease. The UI should be simple enough to be understood by everyone. It can be made even easy if there is provided an option for choosing different languages. 

3.) Accuracy - The system should ensure that the data stored about the books, and the fines calculates should be correct and consistent. 

4.) Maintainability - Updating information on the system should be made as easy as possible. The current system should work properly even if any changes are made. In case the system is required to be updated with new features, it should work properly.

5.) Performance - The system should respond to requests within two to three seconds.

6.) Reliability - The system should be available for the duration when the library operates. There should not occur any failure in the system during this particular time.

7.) Scalability - The system should not give an error and work reliably when more users are accessing the system.

8.) Portability -  It is possible to access the database in any system other than the system in which it is created.

9.) Security - The system would ask a user for a username and password for entering into the system. It should also make sure that it works on the institute LAN.

1.) The system should recognize any voice in the list without any fault. The Response of the system should be fast and error-free and the performance of the system should not decrease by time or usage.

2.) The system should be easy to learn and easy to use. It can provide a help page to all new users to make proper use of the system.

3.) The Admin and the user should get notified in case any error or system failure occurs.

4.) The system should support addition of new voices without changing old ones.

5.) The response time of any query should be small to make sure it fulfills the needs.
